### Description: 
-----------------------------------------------
Attending technology events and conferences is very important for networking, knowledge enhancement and new opportunities. TechSource seeks to provide exposure to all tech events in a given cities and allow users interested in attending tech events to be able to explore different ones on this web application. 

### Tech Stack: 
-----------------------------------------------
- React 
- Redux
- Bootstrap 
- Google Maps API 


### Stretch Goals
-----------------------------------------------
I would like a subscription feature that allows users to sign up for a weekly email newsletter that contains details of different events.
